`How long did you spend on the technical test? what would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.`

I spent about 2-5 hours on this test of actual codeing, it was not difficult per-say, but I ran into bugs and issues with Selenium. Most of the time was spent figuring out the issues, setup, and making a github page for it. 

# 2.
`What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?`

The diffuculty of test automation, the learning curve to test application have become easier over the years with may different application have came and made it easier to:
* Test application (ie:Selenium, and Junit)
* Understand the testing (Cucumber/Gherkin)

# 3. 
`How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? have you ever had to do this?`

Depends of the application, but I would use a similar frameworld like selenium that would allow me to interact and extract information from said application. 

`have you ever had to do this?`No I have not done this before.

# 4. 
`How would you improve hte cusomer experience of the JUST EAT website?`

I would allow the user to input other values other than the postal code. 
* Street number 
* Interesction 
* ect.
